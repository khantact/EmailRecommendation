# EmailRecommendation

For Hack the Sharks hackathon, partnered with Jaanhvi Agarwal
<br>
Problem statement: "Participants have to develop an automated system that sends recommendations email to users using SMTP and fetch research papers from sites like IEEE , Springler websites and send it to user, based on their interests."
<br>
The deployed site can be accessed at https://loremr.vercel.app/, the website is still under development so it may contain bugs
