<h1>Problem statement</h1>

"Participants have to develop an automated system that sends recommendations email to users using SMTP and fetch research 
papers from sites like IEEE , Springler websites and send it to user, based on their interests."

The deployed site can be accessed at https://loremr.vercel.app/, the website is still under development so it may contain bugs
